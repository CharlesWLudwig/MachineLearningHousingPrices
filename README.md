# Make our own Linear Regression model

# Concepts:
    # Regularization
    # Polynomial Feature Selection
    # Feature Normalization

# pip install:
    # sci-kit learn 

# We will:
    # split datasets / make predictions on the test set
    # tune hyperparameterrs like regularization, to ensure the model is more accurate on the basis of the test set
    # Find the accuracy / error of the model being made
    # We will be using the California housing dataset from the sci-kit learn library
